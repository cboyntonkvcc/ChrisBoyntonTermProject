# ChrisBoyntonTermProject

This is my Final project for my CIS 298 class at kvcc.
The app both sends a random reminder text and will send contact info depending on 
which you want to do.


IMPORTANT
Please have a Contact in the contacts with a Phone number in order for the app to work properly.
If you don't you will get nulls instead of name because of the way I pulled the data
from the database. The app still work just not up to its full potential. This was a last
minute bug I found because most my contacts have numbers in them, it never accured to me to test with a contact without a number. This is something I will look into fixing in the future.
